# point-of-sale
Point of sale app component with React

This is  for shops and business to build their mobile storefront.
It features a list of items in inventory, a create new item panel, checkout and edit, and pay confirmation pages.
A shopping cart is saved in user's local storage. UI and Touch animation for lists and form input are inspired by iOS.

note: Currently there are breaking changes with the React Native upgrade to ver 0.34 (I originally built this a year ago), I am scouting for fixes.
It is possible there is a missing promise library that is incompatible in React Native environment. If anyone knows this fix let me know. :)
