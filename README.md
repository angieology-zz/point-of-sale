# point-of-sale
Point of sale app component with React

This is  for shops and business to build their mobile storefront.
It features a list of items in inventory, a create new item panel, checkout and edit, and pay confirmation pages.

note: Currently there are breaking changes with the React Native upgrade, I am scouting for fixes.
It is possible there is a missing promise library. If anyone knows this fix please let me know. :)
